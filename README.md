# Descriptive-Statistics-On-Adult-DataSet

Perform Descriptive Statistics on "Adult" DataSet, hosted on the UCI’s Machine Learning Repository.

I considered a public database called the “Adult” dataset, hosted on the UCI’s Machine Learning Repository. It contains approximately 32,000 observations concerning different financial parameters related to the US population: age, sex, marital (marital status of the individual), country, income (Boolean variable: whether the person makes more than $50,000 per annum), education (the highest level of education achieved by the individual), occupation, capital gain, etc.
